# Apostrophe starter kit for Astro integration

This is intended as both a template and starting point for an Apostrophe project with a
separate front end powered by [Astro](https://astro.build/).

To complete your project, you will need to fork **both** this project
and our [astro-frontend](https://github.com/bodonkey/astro-template-frontend) project.

Then, you need to run both with the `APOS_EXTERNAL_FRONT_KEY` environment variable set to the same string in both projects.
